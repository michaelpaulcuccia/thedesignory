Thank you for the opportunity to take this test. I really enjoyed this challenge and I hope that you appreciate my efforts. Here are my thoughts...

The biggest obstacle was the absence of external CSS frameworks. Making the application responsive across a variety of screen sizes without media queries or a responsive grid was a huge challenge. One attempt with Flex-Box worked well for Desktops but poorly on Mobile Devices: https://boiling-atoll-76313.herokuapp.com/. Then there was another that worked with Mobile but not Desktop: https://lit-basin-51484.herokuapp.com/. Ultimately, I switched to CSS Grid which managed to split the difference on between Desktop and Mobile but unfortunately not without some distortion.

Also, not having Bootstrapâ€™s Rows, Columns, or Cards to build components added yet another layer of complexity. I had never used the Styled-Components library before but I really liked how it behaves like JavaScript. I plan on learning more about how to use it for future projects.

The easiest part of this project for me was working with the data from the API. I was very comfortable working within Functions and Hooks to create, manipulate, and display data throughout the application.

I would love to get your feedback after reviewing my code.
